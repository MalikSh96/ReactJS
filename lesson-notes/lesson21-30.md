# LESSON 21
# Basics of Form Handling
We want React to control the `form` elements, such `form` elements whose value is ***controlled*** by React is called a **Controlled Component**.

We deal with values that change within a component with `state` and `setState`, so in a **controlled component** the value of an input field is set to the `state` property.

**See `Form.js`**
